This blog post introduces interactive visualizations built using the Building Inventory dataset, highlighting key patterns and trends in building square footage and acquisition years.

## 1. Overview of the Dataset

The Building Inventory dataset contains detailed information about buildings, including their square footage, year of acquisition, and city. By analyzing this data, we can uncover trends in urban development and infrastructure allocation.

## 2. Visualization Highlights

### Top 10 Cities by Total Square Footage
This bar chart showcases the top 10 cities with the largest building square footage. Using an intuitive layout and hover-enabled tooltips, it emphasizes cities with significant infrastructure.

### Square Footage Trends Over Time
The scatter plot combines data points with a trend line to reveal how square footage correlates with acquisition years. An interactive dropdown filter enables users to explore data for specific cities, making the analysis more focused and insightful.

## 3. Methods and Tools

These visualizations were created using Python, Altair, and Vega-Lite. Data preprocessing ensured that only complete and relevant records were visualized, while design choices like color schemes and interactivity enhanced clarity and usability.

## 4. Why It Matters

Understanding how building square footage and acquisition trends vary can inform urban planning and resource allocation decisions. By leveraging interactive visualizations, stakeholders can make data-driven decisions efficiently.
